| 1   | Many unused variables in some classes                                                                                                                                                         | Remove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Makes code easier to read                                                 |
| 2   | Empty constructors which are never used                                                                                                                                                       | Remove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Makes code more readable                                                  |
| 3   | Presentation, SlideViewerFrame and SlideViewerComponent do not have a clear relationship. Recursive relationships, there is need to send one object as an argument in extremely many methods. | Change the application class relationship. Make the SlideViewFrame(ApplicationWindow)->SlideViewerComponent(PresentationComponent)->Presentation relationship.                                                                                                                                  | Easier to extend, debug  and understand the application.                  |
| 4   | Go To slide will update the slide counter with any value inputted, although if such a slide number does not exist, the slide will remain the same.                                            | Make a check for the slide number before updating the counter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Fix a bug.                                                                |
| 5   | Each controller has a different way to be added to the main application (frame).                                                                                                              | Create a new interface ApplicationController for all other controllers to implement. Create a new class Controller which keeps track of all of the controllers which implement the interface and of the application. The controller starts the application and binds all the controllers to it. | Gives a better hierarchy for the project. Easier to add a new controller. |
| 6   | Style class keeps track of the styles available.                                                                                                                                              | Keep the styles available in the PresentationComponent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | The structure is more logical. Easier to access the styles.               |
| 7   | Many variables have meaningless naming.                                                                                                                                                       | Rename every variable/argument/mehtod into more appropriate names for their tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Better readability.                                                       |
